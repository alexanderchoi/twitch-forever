# twitch-forever

twitch-forever is a chrome extension that allows users to continually watch twitch streams of Eternal, an online card game, while automatically redirecting to a new stream if the stream goes offline, all without any user input.

The end result of this is to passively receive free in-game drops from watching the streams.
